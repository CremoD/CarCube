# CarCube
This software is part of a University Project. It is an application which manages a multibrand car dealership. The application is built on top of a SQL database. By means of the application, it is possible to add/delete/modify cars and their attributes, to add customers/suppliers and their contact information and to see useful statistics about the income and outcome of such car dealership.
The development of this software is a contribution of three students of the Free University of Bolzano, attending the Faculty of Computer Science: Davide Cremonini, Davide Sbetti, Davide Perez.
